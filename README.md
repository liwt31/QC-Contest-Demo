# Solution by Tencent Quantum Lab

The solution is in `get_energy.ipynb`.

Two circuits are used for this task, generated from `get_energy.ipynb` in qasm format. All three noise models share the same set of circuits. `circuit.txt` is the circuit for energy evaluation. `circuit_em.txt` is the circuit for error mitigation.

To install dependencies for the notebook, simply run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Note `qiskit` must be the newest version.

Or directly run the notebook in binder:
